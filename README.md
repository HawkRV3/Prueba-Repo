Vulnerabilities:

JavaScript Injection (XSS - Cross-Site Scripting): The application is vulnerable to JavaScript injection. If a user inputs a username that includes HTML or JavaScript code, it will be executed.
Solution:
Use secure methods to manipulate the DOM, such as textContent or programmatically creating elements and adding them to the DOM.

Insecure Credential Storage (commented out):
Even though storing credentials in localStorage has been commented out, it is important to note that storing credentials on the client side (browser) is a bad security practice.
Solution:
Never store credentials on the client side. Use secure methods to handle authentication, such as sessions or authentication tokens.

Weak Credential Validation:
Credentials are hardcoded directly into the JavaScript code. This is insecure and not scalable.
Solution:
Implement credential validation on the server side, not on the client side. Credentials should be securely sent to the server for validation.

Lack of Encryption for Data Transmission:
There is no mention of using HTTPS for data transmission, which is crucial for protecting credentials during their transmission.
Solution:
Ensure that the application uses HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and the server.
